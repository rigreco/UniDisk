# This is a basic workflow for Merlin32 cross-dev Tools with GitHub Actions for UNIDISK project
# https://brutaldeluxe.fr/products/crossdevtools/

# The Actions are based on digarok repository:
# https://github.com/digarok/install-merlin32-action
# https://github.com/digarok/install-cadius-action

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
    paths:
      - 'src/TESTBAS'
      - 'src/TESTBIN.s'
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]
    paths: 
      - 'src/TESTBAS'
      - 'src/TESTBIN.s'

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
  
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
